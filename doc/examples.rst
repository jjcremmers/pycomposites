Examples
========

The source code for the examples is provided in the directories
``examples/jupyter`` and ``examples/python``.

These examples include practical exercises covering:

- **Classical laminate theory** – stiffness matrices, stress–strain relations,
  and laminate response.
- **Failure analysis** – application of common failure criteria to composite laminates.
- **Plate equations** – numerical examples of plate bending and deflection problems.

The Jupyter notebooks (``examples/jupyter``) are interactive and well suited
for teaching, self-study, and demonstration purposes.

The Python scripts (``examples/python``) provide standalone implementations
that can be executed directly, making them useful as templates for custom projects.

.. note::

   To run the Jupyter notebooks, ensure that Jupyter is installed in your environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install jupyterlab
      jupyter lab
